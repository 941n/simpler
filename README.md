# The existing code worked fine on desktops, but I found that it had latency on mobile browsers. So I dug around to find a way to fix it, and I found that I could use the built-in object AudioContext

## When I checked the MDN documentation, there were a lot of unfamiliar methods and content, so it wasn't easy to get started, but I feel a sense of satisfaction once I took the first step.

### For the next development, I want to allow users to set sample sounds directly for each pad, and even upload samples from their own devices and insert them into the pads.
